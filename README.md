# David's Pitfall : The Lost Expedition Repository

I dump random stuff, mods and research data on the game.

## Contents

- `/Memory Research` : Everything regarding reverse engineering on the game, knowledge base
	- `/PC/Ghidra` : Ghidra project for PC. This holds tremendous information on the game and continues to grow as we discover more
	- `/PC/PitFall - The Lost Expedition.CT` : Cheat Engine table.
	- `/PC/Virtual tables.txt` : Known virtual tables of objects that the game manages. These can be used in Cheat Engine memory searches to quickly find instances of one given type of object.
- `/Mods/PTLE_Mods` : Mods for PC & SDK for making your own!
	- `/src` : Source code for mods & utilities

## Various Goals

- Randomizer mod port from Dolphin to PC
- Spawning instances of Harry at any time
- Playing as animal spirits (monkey, scorpion, penguin) in normal levels
- Playing as NPCs (native, henchman, Supai...)
- General reverse engineering of the game, on PC and console versions
- Asset conversion tools to usual formats (e.g. Pitfall model to FBX)
- Multiplayer mod
